# CDI

> **Research status:** CCT Level 1 is an evidence-gated investigation of a compact causal language engine. This repository does not currently make a production-quality, long-context, throughput, or fluency claim.

## Active Implementation

The active language-engine path is **`cdi.v3`**. It uses the EthioBBPE tokenizer adapter, a compact selective cohomodynamic recurrent state-space model, a sparse graph-Laplacian correction, a tied output projection, and matched GRU/Transformer baselines. The authoritative execution protocol and gates are recorded in [`Todo.md`](Todo.md).

| [`docs/CCT_G3_5_DECISION.md`](docs/CCT_G3_5_DECISION.md) | Recorded G3.5 result: `NO_FUSION_EVIDENCE`; CCT-G3.4 residual CDI retained; performance readiness required before training. |

| [`docs/CCT_G3_6_DECISION.md`](docs/CCT_G3_6_DECISION.md) | Recorded G3.6 result: `EARNED_BOUNDED_CONTINUATION`; eligible for one separately reviewed next rung; no automatic scale. |
| [`docs/PERFORMANCE_READINESS.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE_READINESS.md) | Performance gate: `BOUNDED_RUNTIME_READY`; 297 tests passed and short-context CDI throughput improved approximately 21%. |
| [`benchmarks/cct_g3_3_harmonic_ablation.py`](benchmarks/cct_g3_3_harmonic_ablation.py) | CPU-safe executable G3.3 harness with 11 GiB guard and fixed-held-out state/gradient diagnostics. |
| [`benchmarks/cct_g3_4_token_residual.py`](benchmarks/cct_g3_4_token_residual.py) | CPU-safe executable G3.4 five-model quality-recovery harness with a 2% material-GRU target. |
| [`benchmarks/cct_g3_5_residual_fusion.py`](benchmarks/cct_g3_5_residual_fusion.py) | CPU-safe executable G3.5 five-model state-conditioned fusion harness with the same 2% material-GRU target. |
| [`benchmarks/cct_g3_6_bounded_quality.py`](benchmarks/cct_g3_6_bounded_quality.py) | Corrected three-model retained-residual CDI, GRU, and Transformer bounded continuation harness. |

CCT-G3.1 established repeated sparse-geometry value, CCT-G3.2 established repeated contrast-readout value, CCT-G3.3 established repeated harmonic-memory-band value, and CCT-G3.4 established repeated token-residual value under capacity-matched three-seed comparisons. The selected CCT-G3.4 residual CDI beats GRU in every seed but falls short of the separate 2% material-quality margin, so its decision is `QUALITY_RECOVERY_PARTIAL`. CCT-G3.5 earned `NO_FUSION_EVIDENCE` and is closed. Performance readiness is now `BOUNDED_RUNTIME_READY`: semantics-preserving runtime repairs passed the full 297-test regression and improved short-context CDI throughput by approximately 21%. CCT-G3.6 is complete with `EARNED_BOUNDED_CONTINUATION`: retained CDI reached 6.576891 mean validation loss, beat GRU in all three seeds, and passed the 2% target. The system is **eligible for one separately reviewed next quality rung**; automatic 3,000-step scaling, larger-data scaling, context expansion, capacity changes, and fluency claims remain blocked.

## Safe Setup and Validation

Use Python 3.12 or a compatible environment, then install the declared dependency contract.

```bash
git clone --branch master --single-branch https://github.com/nexuss0781/CDI.git
cd CDI
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import ethiobbpe; print('EthioBBPE OK:', ethiobbpe.__file__)"
pytest -q
```

The complete current regression command is `pytest -q`. The repository-safe convenience interface does not train or fetch external data:

```bash
./run.sh status
./run.sh readiness
```

`./run.sh readiness` runs the clean-master CCT-G0 environment and regression verifier. Generated benchmark artifacts are written under their configured `results/` directories rather than tracked documentation paths.

## CCT Execution Discipline

Every CCT experiment must retain the approved tokenizer artifact, governed split, context, optimizer, precision, token budget, seed list, and matched baseline protocol unless the Todo gate explicitly authorizes a single change. A result must be reviewed against the complete executable CCT transition rule, including finite values, learning, Transformer tolerance, and the declared GRU relation.

> **Do not use `bash run.sh production`, `train.py`, or the top-level `cdi` legacy API as CCT evidence.** External production ingestion/training is fail-closed because it lacks an approved immutable source registry and split-safe data contract. The v2 code remains as a legacy mathematical reference, not the active CCT training route.
